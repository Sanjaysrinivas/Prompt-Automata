# Global Token Processing Results

1: Global Token Counter Module
Implemented core token counting functionality with real-time block tracking and aggregation

## Output
- Created files: `global_token_counter.py`, `token_status.py`
- Core changes:
  - Implemented GlobalTokenCounter with event system and block tracking
  - Added token aggregation logic and change detection
  - Created synchronous token counting wrapper
  - Added block registration system

## Notes
- Implemented thread-safe async/await patterns for reliable updates
- Added blueprint registration hook to ensure clean state on startup

## Testing
Verified accurate counting across multiple blocks, tested synchronous updates and change detection

2: Floating Dialog UI
Created persistent token status indicator with real-time updates

## Output
- Modified files: `token_counter_card.html`, `fence-events.js`
- Core changes:
  - Implemented token status card with model capacity visualization
  - Added real-time UI updates through event system
  - Created block size breakdown display

## Notes
- Integrated with existing fence block event system
- Ensured smooth UI updates with proper event handling

## Testing
Confirmed dialog displays correctly with accurate model capacities and responsive updates

3: Reference Token Integration
Added comprehensive token counting for references and files

## Output
- Modified files: `global_token_counter.py`, `fence-block.js`
- Core changes:
  - Added reference token counting system
  - Implemented file and API reference handling
  - Created variable reference resolution

## Notes
- Integrated with existing reference system
- Added efficient caching for reference resolution

## Testing
Verified counting accuracy with various reference types and file inclusions

4: Integration and Optimization
Connected token counting system with existing components

## Output
- Modified files: `__init__.py`, `token_status.py`
- Core changes:
  - Connected with fence block system
  - Implemented caching mechanisms
  - Added error recovery handling

## Notes
- Optimized performance for large number of blocks
- Added graceful error handling for edge cases

## Testing
Validated integration with fence blocks, performance optimizations, and error recovery
