"""Utility functions and helpers.

This empty __init__.py file serves several important purposes:
1. Marks this directory as a Python package, enabling imports like 'from src.app.utils.exceptions import raise_bad_request'
2. Prevents Python's relative import system from getting confused about the package root
3. Can be used to expose specific functions/classes at the package level (if needed in the future)
4. Helps tools and IDEs with module discovery and auto-completion
